  description: " **Legato Service Order Management**\n\nThe intent of this API is to provide a consistent/standardized mechanism to manipulate the Service instances (and in turn the Service fulfillment) through Service Orders. The Service Order API can be invoked by the Business Applications (BA) systems to initiate Service Orders that manipulate the Service fulfillment process by the Service Orchestration Function (SOF).\n\nThe scope of this API introduces the following capabilities to the API:\n\n•\tADD: Request a new Service\n\n•\tMODIFY: Change an existing Service\n\n•\tDELETE:  Delete an existing Service\n\n•\tNO_CHANGE:\n\n•\tSupport for Service Order Notifications\n\n•\tThe client could also retrieve a single, or set, of Service Orders based upon a specified filter."

      description: 'This operation creates a Service Order instance in the Service Order management system maintained by the SOF. A Service Order is used to request operations on a Service instance. A Service Order groups one or more one Service Order Items - one per specific action on a Service instance. The Action associated with the Service Order Item describes the operation (add, remove, update) to be applied on the specified Service instance. The Service Order Item and its associated Action can operate on both existing (remove, update) as well as future (add) Service instance. The Service Order is triggered from the Business Application (BA) system in charge of the Product Order management to the Service Orchestration Function (SOF) system that will orchestrate the Service fulfillment. The assumption is that the Service Specifications describing the Service instance in the Service Order Item are already available (to both BA & SOF). If an exception is encountered, then appropriate returnCode and error information is populated and returned as specified.'

        List of possible state for the Service Order. 

        * ACKNOWLEDGED - Order has been received and has passed message validation.

        * IN_PROGRESS - Service Fulfillment has started.

        * PENDING - Order is currently in a waiting stage for an explicitly action/activity to be completed before the order can progress further, pending order amend or cancel assessment. A pending stage can lead into auto cancellation of an order, if no action is take within the defined timeframes to be described under the Agreement.

        * HELD - Order cannot be progressed due to a temporary issue. For example, processing is temporarily delayed to resolve an infrastructure shortfall to facilitate supply of order. Upon resolution of the issue, the order will continue to progress.

        * CANCELLED - In-Flight Order has been successfully cancelled.

        * COMPLETED - Provisioning completed and the Service is now active.

        * FAILED - All of the Order items have failed which results in the entire Order to be Failed.

        * PARTIAL - Some of the Order items processing have failed and some have succeeded so the entire Order is in a Partial state. This provides support for partial Failure of an Order.

        * REJECTED - An order failed the Order Feasibility checks. Service technical eligibility is not done throught service order API but with dedicated serviceQualification API (from preOrdering domain) invalid information is provided through the order request. The order request fails to meet business rules for ordering.

The Business Application (BA) triggers the Service Orchestration Function (SOF) to create/update/delete a Service via the Service Order/Service Order Item operations. The SOF is responsible for orchestrating the Service fulfillment and maintaining Service instance state/attributes and notifying BA of any changes. Functionally, a Service is instantiated using a related Service Specification instance as its template. Thus the Services that share the same Service Specification instance would therefore share the same set of characteristics. The MEF Service classes that describe a specific type of MEF Service instance will be associated with the Service Specification class, as well as the Service instances will contain a reference to the MEF Service schema.The assumption is that the Service Specifications describing the Service instance in the Service Order Item are already available (to both BA & SOF).'
